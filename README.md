# Vue Calendar

A series of simple calendar based components for Vue.js projects.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this library. First, is using the individual YearView, MonthView, and DayView. Second, is to use the CalendarView component, which allows navigating to specific dates using the router. Using this component requires VueRouter being included in the project.

## Contributions

There are still many features to be added, including I18N and accessibility. Contributions to those fields, as well as feedback on suggested features, are always welcome.
